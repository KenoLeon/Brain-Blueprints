# Brain-Blueprints
Brain Blueprints is a project aimed at providing a simplified overview of the systems and functions within the human brain. The goal is to break down the complexity of the brain into a more easily digestible model, which can serve as a foundation for attempts to emulate the brain artificially and for education and research in related fields such as neuroscience.
